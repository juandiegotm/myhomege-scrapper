# Running the scraper
First, install the dependencies: 

```
npm install
```

Then, execute the scrapper: 

```
npm run start
```

It's important to explain the .env variables:

- VIP_ALLOWED: Set to 1 if you want to allow VIP access when the attribute vipStatus is present, set to 0 otherwise.
- ENABLE_PURCHASES: Set to 1 if you want to complete the process and publish the flat, set to 0 if you want to save it in the unpaid tab.
